    for VMs:

        submit -c -m testbox=vm-2p8g borrow-1h.yaml

    for HWs:

        submit -c -m testbox=taishan200-2280-2s48p-256g borrow-1h.yaml

    Login testbox to renew the lease, before testbox expires.
    get testbox lease:
        lkp-renew -g
    renew N days:

## 5. Return testbox

    Return manually(recommended):

        Manually execute 'reboot' in time to return the testbox.
        Avoid a waste of computer resource with no-load running.

    - All testboxes will be returned if it has been executed command 'reboot'.
    - The testbox cannot be accessed any more after it has been returned.
